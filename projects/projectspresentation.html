## Structure of the projects

* Teams of two students, exceptionally you can do it on your own
if you have difficulties to coordinate remotely.

* Developing the project in teams is necessary not only for learning to
work as a team, but also to develop our social coding skills in GitHub.

* All projects have the same structure: answer a question by combining
information from two different CSV files.

* There is no right answer to the question (except in specific cases).
The project is about data exploration.

* No need to do formal statistics. Gather insight into the data through
visualization and summarization.

* Projects have to be developed independently within each team, two teams
  cannot submit identical code for the same project.

---

## Project submission

* The project will be developed and submitted in the same form as the
  _assignments_ made with GitHub Classroom.

* Because projects will be carried out in teams of two, the acceptance
  of the assignment in GitHub Classroom is slightly different than with
  individual assignments:

  1. You should agree in your group, who of the two members accepts first
  the assignment of the project, by following the corresponding link.
  2. Once that member follows the link, he/she should give a name to the
  team. The team name should be form exclusively by letters, numbers or
  the dash (`-`) character. **PLEASE DO NOT USE SPACES, ACCENTS, ANY
  NON-ASCII-STANDARD CHARACTERS OR ANY SYMBOL OTHER THAN THE DASH (`-`)**.
  3. Once the first member has given the team name and accepted the
  assignment, the second member should follow the assignment link,
  search for his/her corresponding team name and select it.

* The URL of the repo of the project will be of the form:  
  `https://github.com/funcompbio2021/project-xxxx-yyyy`  
  where `xxxx` will be the project name and `yyyy` the team name.

## How to resolve (GitHub) conflicts

* When working in a common GitHub repo with other people, you may
encounter the situation in which two or more people make changes
to the same file, creating a so-called _merge conflict_.

* You can learn about how to resolve merge conflicts from these
two sources:

  * [GitHub documentation](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts)
  * [A blog post at Medium](https://medium.com/@RedRoxProjects/how-do-i-git-three-ways-to-solve-a-merge-conflict-cde4d7924c80)
