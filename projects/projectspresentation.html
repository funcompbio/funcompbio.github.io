## Structure of the projects

* Groups of two students, exceptionally you can do it on your own
if you have difficulties to coordinate remotely.

* Developing the project in groups is necessary not only for learning to
work as a team, but also to develop our social coding skills in GitHub.

* All projects have the same structure: answer a question by combining
information from two different CSV files.

* There is no right answer to the question (except in specific cases).
The project is about data exploration.

* No need to do formal statistics. Gather insight into the data through
visualization and summarization.

* Projects have to be developed within each group, two groups cannot
submit identical code for the same project.

## How to merge data

* You can combine information from two different CSV files in, at least,
three ways:

  1. In Unix, using the `join` command. See this
  [blog post](https://shapeshed.com/unix-join) on how to use it.

  2. In R, using the `merge()` function. See this
  [blog post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/10/how-to-perform-merges-joins-on-two-or-more-data-frames-with-base-r-tidyverse-and-data-table) on how to use it.

  3. In R, using the `match()` function:
  ```
  > y <- 1:10
  > x <- 6:11
  > mt <- match(x, y)
  [1]  6  7  8  9 10 NA
  ```

* In either method you need to identify a column with common information
  in both CSV files (e.g., country name).

## How to resolve conflicts

* When working in a common GitHub repo with other people, you may
encounter the situation in which two or more people make changes
to the same file, creating a so-called _merge conflict_.

* You can learn about how to resolve merge conflicts from these
two sources:

  * [GitHub documentation](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts)
  * [A blog post at Medium](https://medium.com/@RedRoxProjects/how-do-i-git-three-ways-to-solve-a-merge-conflict-cde4d7924c80)
