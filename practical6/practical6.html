<h1 id="objectives">Objectives</h1>
<p>This practical has been developed in collaboration with Dr. Javier Macia to strengthen some of the concepts and methods developed in the Mathematics subject, jointly with FCB. The learning objectives for this practical are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement in Python the SIR model of spreading infectious diseases.</li>
<li>Parametrize the Python implementation from the command line.</li>
<li>Use the implemented model to explore effect of different parameters.</li>
<li>Make syntax errors in Python.</li>
<li>Correct syntax errors in Python.</li>
<li>Debug your program when it doesn't work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever you are stuck with an error, please consult the section entitled &quot;Debugging&quot; from <a href="/practical4/">practical 4</a>.</p>
<h1 id="setup-and-background">Setup and background</h1>
<p>To do this practical you need an installation of Python version 3. You can find the instructions in the <a href="/setup/">setup</a> link on how to install Python version 3 in your system. Once Python is installed, you should be able to call it from the shell in the terminal window. You can check whether that is possible by typing:</p>
<pre><code>$ which python
$ python --version</code></pre>
<p>It may happen that you have two Python installations, one corresponding to version 2.x and another to version 3.x. In that situation the previous command may say that your Python version is 2.x and to access the version 3 you need to call the executable <code>python3</code>. Try then for instance:</p>
<pre><code>$ python3 --version</code></pre>
<p>If this is your case, then whenever the executable <code>python</code> is invoked in the rest of this practical, please use <code>python3</code> instead.</p>
<h1 id="the-sir-model-of-spreading-infectious-diseases">The SIR model of spreading infectious diseases</h1>
<p>A simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology">SIR model</a> of spreading an infection can be described with the following differential equation:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$\frac{dI}{dt}=\rho\cdot I \cdot (1 - I) - \alpha \cdot I\.$$</span><br /></p>
